## SkyWars
SkyWars is a fun, small multiplayer game I made on MakeCode. Shoot bogeys and get big, all while being the last one standing!  

## Game Directions

- Move around freely with the joystick.
- Shoot Bogey Ships
- If the ships touch you, you lose a life. You have 3 lives :)
- Be the last one standing to win! If the last one standing dies, they win. That's how it actually works.
- You will get big with more points. Show 'em who's boss!

## Bugs? Errors? Comments? Something Else?
You can always reach you to me through the issues and pull request tab. I would love to hear your opinions and reviews! 

## Credits
Credits to some MakeCode forum friends, AbstractDesginer and InvalidProject, for their songs!

And that's all! This is actually my first ever extension/github game! Have fun, and stay alive!!!
